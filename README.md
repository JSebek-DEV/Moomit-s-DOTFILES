There is also custom script that controlls volume and sends notifications. Put it in /home/username/
You can use bashrc textfile that contains configuration for terminal output.
to make it work launch terminal and write nano ~/.bashrc
then paste the bashrc text file text inside.
it will do this: 
1.Display you like so:  moomit ~:
show where you are for example if you type cd yay it will show you:  moomit ~/yay: wich i think is very cool
2. When you type unknown command it will write Command not found in red color for better clarity
